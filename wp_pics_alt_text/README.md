# WordPress Pics Utility
## About
When I'm working in WordPress, I found sometime frustrating to give a proper name to the picture files
and then to add an alternative text.

What generally happens is that I create a design in Canva, after naming it in a format similar to:
`this-is-the-name.png`.

I don't want to manually remove the `-` and the ending format (e.g. `.png`) when giving an alternative text during the pics upload on WordPress.

So, I'm using this quick tool to basically have a name ready to be copy-pasted.

## Usage
```
ruby magic.rb "picture-name.png"
```

## Todo
* Work with arrays in input
* Convert also into .webp format
